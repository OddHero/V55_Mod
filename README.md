# V55_Mod

This repository contains my code from following the let's mod reboot tutorials of Pahimar back in 2014.
I never made it into a mod so its now archived, but the whole ide setup was pretty cool so I keep it as a reference to look at.

#### If you want to help or just want to compile my sourcecode follow the excellent description provided by Pahimar for his mod EE3:

[Pahimars README](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3/blob/master/README.md),
just change the clone url to this repository and change the folder name to V55_Mod
